# Elevators Mod
Adds in Server-Side Elevators to BTA!

Steel Blocks subsititute as the block for your elevators. 
In order to create one, place a block down and one directly above or below it any set distance (with no obstructions inbetween!).
Then, jump to go upwards, or sneak to go down!

Enjoy moving vertically in style (❛̃ ͜ʖ❛̃)
